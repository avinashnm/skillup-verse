HTTP and HTML
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):

HTTP is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web.
It's a protocol used for transmitting hypertext requests and responses between web servers and clients.
HTTP operates as a request-response protocol, where a client sends a request to a server, and the server responds with the requested resource.
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):

HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages.
It defines the structure and content of web pages using elements, tags, and attributes.
HTML documents consist of nested elements representing the hierarchical structure of content, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and links.
Benefits:

HTTP enables efficient communication between web servers and clients, facilitating the retrieval and display of web content.
HTML provides a standardized way to structure web pages, ensuring consistency and interoperability across different browsers and platforms.
